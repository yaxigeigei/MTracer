MTracer v0.1.4
Remove NP.KilosortResult.ComputeBasicStats. Basic cluster stats such as numSpikes is now computed in any cluster metrics functions (i.e. ComputeContamStats and ComputeWaveformStats).
Add NP.KilosortResult.LabelClusters for assigning cluster groups.
All clusters now have unique and immutable cluster IDs. Change MergeClusters and CutClusters accordingly.

MTracer v0.1.3
Cache the raw spike map and the computed clustering results.
Add an option for choosing the data source (imec.ap.bin or temp_wh.dat) for AP traces.
Can read incomplete curation results.
Implement Merge traces.
Change the cutoff frequency of the motion highpass filter from 0.2Hz to 0.1Hz.
Add power spectrum plot in trace Inspection window.
Add Merge and Cut methods in KilosortResults class.
Misc optimizations in UI.
Remove dependencies no longer in use.
